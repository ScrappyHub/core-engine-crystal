# ENGINE GOVERNANCE — CRYSTAL (LATTICE & MOLECULAR)

Authority Level: Engine Governance (Binding)  
Engine Role: TRUTH_ENGINE  
Status: ✅ BINDING | ✅ NON-OPTIONAL  

---

## 1. GOVERNANCE INHERITANCE

CRYSTAL is bound by CORE governance:

- CORE_CONSTITUTIONAL_STOP_LAYER.md  
- CORE_PLATFORM_CONSTITUTION.md  
- CORE_ENGINE_REGISTRY_AND_VERTICAL_INHERITANCE_LAW.md  
- CORE_ENGINE_REGISTRY_CONTRACT.md  
- CORE_GOVERNANCE_INDEX_CHAIN_OF_AUTHORITY.md  

---

## 2. ENGINE ROLE & SCOPE

CRYSTAL computes **lattice and molecular-scale domain truth**, including:

- resonant modes  
- frequency shifts  
- phonon or lattice vibration proxies  
- piezoelectric indicators (if modeled)  

---

## 3. NON-SCOPE (PROHIBITIONS)

CRYSTAL MUST NOT:

- make biological or medical claims  
- infer health or exposure effects  
- access networks  
- publish independently  
- call other engines directly  

---

## 4. DETERMINISM

CRYSTAL outputs MUST be reproducible under identical parameters.

---

## 5. OUTPUT & SEALING

Outputs MUST be deterministic, sealed, and schema-validated.

---

## 6. SAFETY CONSTRAINTS

CRYSTAL MUST:

- label uncertainty and scale limits  
- prohibit extrapolation beyond modeled domain  

---

## 7. CHANGE CONTROL

Registry update and audit required for changes.

---

## 8. FINAL DECLARATION

CRYSTAL produces **molecular-scale physics truth only**.
